# Gasoline-Price-In-Romania-Viz
BI monthly challenge from Romanian Data Tribe

See dataset details and data here: [Data.World](https://data.world/romanian-data/gasoline-index-in-europe-2022)

In the first half of the year, the price of fuel in Romania has increased considerably. But what happened in other European countries? Picodi.com analyzed the gasoline price changes in Europe and they also calculated how many gasoline liters a person from each European country can buy with their average net salary.

The challenge: Create your version of data visualization for the attached data source. You can also add additional data in your visualization.

Data added is the refined petrol consumption per capita. The motivation to add this data is to give another perspective and my assumption that the gasoline index is not necessarily enough to comparable between European countries where average salary is varies between countries.  Though the additional data is from 2016/2017, this give rough estimation or picture as to why even though the gasoline price is rising, as long as the percentage gasoling spending is still low, then people still can spare large part of their salary for other essential daily needs. This approach might not be ideal and perfect from economic principles but this is just to give another perspective. It is difficult though to find free data about gasoline consumption per capita in the internet, so I used what I could find. 

PS : since Andorra's data is not available, I used average from the other European countries to get the consumption data.
